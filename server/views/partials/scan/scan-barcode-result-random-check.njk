    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Why you need to carry out further checks</h2>
    <p>
      This item of mail was sent by an approved sender, <strong>{{ form.errorCode.createdBy }}</strong>,
      but for additional security it has been selected for a random check.
    </p>
    <p>Carrying out random checks helps prevent Rule 39 mail being used for illegal purposes.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How to deal with the item</h3>
    <p>Check the item for drugs or any other contraband using your usual procedures. For example, use any of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>trace detection equipment</li>
        <li>a dog unit</li>
        <li>an xray machine</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you have concerns about the item, report them to a security manager.</p>
    {% set html %}
      <p>Do not open any item of Rule 39 mail without both:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>permission from a governor</li>
        <li>the recipient being present</li>
      </ul>
