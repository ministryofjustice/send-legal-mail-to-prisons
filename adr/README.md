# Architecture Decision Record

## Overview

This is more accurately an architecture decision history written with hindsight. 

The aim is to document any architectural decisions made during the course of the project that are unusual, non-standard or just need explaining for future devs.

## Decisions
1. [External users authentication](external-users-authentication.md)
2. [External user's session length](external-users-session-length.md)
3. [Split the UI into two apps](internal-external-UIs.md)
4. [Manual CJSM directory upload](manual-cjsm-upload.md)
5. [Smoke test authentication](smoke-test-authentication.md)
